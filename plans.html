            <h2>Career</h2>
            <p>I have goals to work in the game industry for a few years of my life. If not that, then at least somewhere as a software engineer.
                Working somewhere well-known, like Google, would be a dream. I care only enough about money to survive doing what I love, so I wouldn't stay for too long.
                My ultimate achievement would be to start up or co-found an indie game development company. I don't mind the risk. I want to  live for my passions.
            </p>
            <h2>Personal</h2>
            <p>My home life will be largely dependant on my career. I wish to have a job where I have to, and want to, take the work home and think about it.
                As far as my ideas for the future go, I would like to own a decent, small-ish house on a sizable plot of land with a few horses, maybe a cat or dog, and
                plenty of space to invite friends and family over. I imagine myself investing, and owning a few other properties that I rent out. My final touch would 
                be opening a coffee shop and diner with my family.
