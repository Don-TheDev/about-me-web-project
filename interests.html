            <h2>Video Game</h2>
            <p>Games are my passion. That much is true. I have gone from watching them to playing them, then watching and playing.
                Over time, the portions of my interest in them as shifted. I have grown more and more curious in how they work and come together to create
                art. Dwarf Fortress is hands down one of the most complex games to date. It is drawn in simple ASCII graphics which allows more to be put into the 
                functionality of it. It's world-building and systems of systems amaze me so much. The Metal Gear games are great examples of stealth narratives 
                done right. The hand-crafted story weaves in with the mechanics so well. That synergy wows me. The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim has set precedence for 
                so many open world games. It has it's flaws throughout, but none can deny how it captivated masses. It is just the right mix of everything to give
                it max replayability.
            </p>
            <h2>TV Shows</h2>
            <p>Watching TV is more of a hobby for me. I enjoy comedic live-action shows and anime that tugs at the heart-strings. Fruits Basket is a cute anime about
                loneliness and growing closer to others. Lucifer is a show with a lot of NSFW jokes and references. Attack on Titan is about surviving on the brink of
                extinction; there is tons of loss and finding ways to cope or breaking down.
            </p>
            <h2>Books</h2>
            <p>I don't read as much as I used to. Books are still a safe place for me though. Whenever I am feeling down, or just tired of existing for a bit,
                I get lost in a good book. The I Am Number Four saga is a coming-of-age tale about finding others like oneself and defending family. I read the
                Unwind Trilogy when I was a bit younger. It had the dark theme of kids being sold for parts and said kids trying to survive and change the system.
                The Witcher Collection is crazy. It follows the travels of of a mutated monster hunter. It has elements of comedy, drama, and tragedy all blended together.
                I love these books and many more. They are wonderlands of adventure and knowledge.
