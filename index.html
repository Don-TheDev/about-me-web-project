        <h2>Bio</h2>
        <h3>Current</h3>
        <p>I am Donald Williams. I am 18 years old and currently attending <em>Neumont College of Computer Science</em>. I am a 5'6" male. I now live in Utah so I can attend school at Neumont. My current hobbies are programming, skateboarding, playing video
            games, and watching anime.
        </p>
        <h3>History</h3>
        <p>I was born in Tennessee and lived there until I started going to Neumont. I grew up with my mom and 2 younger siblings. My grandmother and uncles have played <strong>major</strong> roles in my life. I have been raised in the country; learning
            to fix problems myself and appreciate nature are ingrained in my soul.
